Our video is attached in the github, and its name is  "RoomWe mini program record.mov"

Unfortunately, we cannot offer you the QR code, since it will refresh every 30 mins. If you downlaod Wechat, we are welcome you to scan the QR code to experience it during class time. 

### wechat github
we have a private wechat's github, here is the link " [clivk here](https://git.weixin.qq.com/wx_wx261460186f631fa3/roomwe1) " . We appologize that you might not have the access to our github so far. The only way to see through the code is to create a wechat account and we will offer you the access to this github(since we cannot make it public). However, you can see some code in the video. If you still have some questions, feel free to ask us in Slack. We understand that Wechat has so many limitations on the access, and  we will try our best to show our current progress. We valur your precious advice and communication is IMPORTANT too. Thank you!
